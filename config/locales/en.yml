              definition: |
                1. Compliance to all F3 criteria, and
                2. Non-compliance to fewer than 10 F2 criteria, and
                3. A total score of 90% or higher
              explanation: |
                The organization is compliant in all key criteria and can demonstrate that the supply chain management processes in use at the facility are best practice.
                Annual assessments are carried out with the goal of ensuring sustainable and best practice processes.
                In support of continual improvement, the development of an action plan should be considered in order to eliminate any remaining unmet criteria.
            B:
              definition: |
                1. Compliance to all F3 criteria, and
                2. Non-compliance of 10 to 15 F2 criteria, and
                3. A total score greater than or equal to 75% and less than 90%
              explanation: |
                Although most of the fundamentals of supply chain management are demonstrated, the organization is deficient in several areas
                that compromises the efficiency of internal performance and may impact its ability to support the needs of the customer.
                An action plan should be developed and implemented in a timeframe that meets the needs of the business and its customer(s).
            C:
              definition: |
                1. Non-compliance to any F3 criterion, or
                2. Non-compliance to 16 or more F2 criteria, or
                3. A total score less than 75%
              explanation: |
                The organization is deficient in one or more key areas of supply chain management.
                This situation creates a high risk of disruption to customers and demonstrates a lack of efficiency and control of internal processes within the existing supply chain strategy.
                Management commitment will be required to create, prioritize and implement action plans in a timely manner to avoid serious or prolonged issues with the customer.

                3. Total score not considered in classification
              explanation: |
                Although most of the fundamentals of supply chain management are demonstrated, the organization is deficient in several areas
                that compromises the efficiency of internal performance and may impact its ability to support the needs of the customer.
                An action plan should be developed and implemented in a timeframe that meets the needs of the business and its customer(s).
            C:
              definition: |
                1. Non-compliance to any F3 criterion, or
                2. Non-compliance to 16 or more F2 criteria, or
                3. Total score not considered in classification
              explanation: |
                The organization is deficient in one or more key areas of supply chain management.
                This situation creates a high risk of disruption to customers and demonstrates a lack of efficiency and control of internal processes within the existing supply chain strategy.
                Management commitment will be required to create, prioritize and implement action plans in a timely manner to avoid serious or prolonged issues with the customer.

      weighting:
        F1:
          definition: "= 1 pt"
          explanation: |
            A Supply Chain Management (SCM) process that demonstrates an additional level of control of operational processes, contributing to the organization's overall competitiveness.
            Complying with F1 criteria contributes to the organization’s long-term sustainability and/or competitiveness.
        F2:
          definition: "= 2 pts"
          explanation: |
            A Supply Chain Management (SCM) process that demonstrates control of operational processes and has significant importance to the efficiency and effectiveness
            of the organization's operations. If an F2 criterion is not met, the organization’s performance and/or customer satisfaction may be seriously affected.
        F3:
          definition: "= 3 pts"
          explanation: |
            A key Supply Chain Management (SCM) process that is a fundamental requirement of the organization's operations.
            If an F3 criterion is not met, there is a high risk of interruption and/or incurring increased costs to the organization's and/or customer's operations.
